# 100_Done_with_R
This project is part of a comprehensive series designed to explore 100 different programs written in R, each demonstrating how this powerful programming language can solve real-life problems across various domains.
## Overview
R is widely used for statistical analysis, data visualization, and data science. This repository aims to showcase the versatility of R by providing practical examples and use cases. Whether you're a beginner looking to strengthen your programming skills or an experienced developer seeking new insights, this collection offers valuable resources to enhance your understanding and proficiency in R.
## Structure
The repository is organized by program categories and includes detailed explanations, code snippets, and use cases for each program. As new programs are introduced in the LinkedIn series, they will be added to this repository.
- **Program 1: Hello World Program**
- **Program 2: Simple Calculator**
- **Program 3: Check for Even or Odd**
- **... (List continues as more programs are added)**

Each directory contains:
- **Code:** The R script implementing the program.
- **Description:** An overview of what the program does.
- **Use Case:** A real-life scenario where this program could be applied.
- **Instructions:** Steps to run the code and any prerequisites.
## Getting Started
To run the programs in this repository, you will need:
- R installed on your machine [(Download R)](https://www.r-project.org)
- An R IDE like RStudio [(Download RStudio)](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html)
## Running the code
1. Clone this repositoty to your local machine: ```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/100_Done_with_R.git```
2. Navigate to the directory of the program you want to run: ```cd 100_Done-with_R/Program_Directory```
4. Open the `.R` file in RStudio or your preferred R environment.
5. Run the code and follow any additional instructions provided in the directory's README file.
